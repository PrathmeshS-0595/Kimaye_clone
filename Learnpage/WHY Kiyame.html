            <br>
            We donâ€™t stop there. All our fruits are impeccable storytellers through our 100% traceability feature. Just flip the fruit, and find a QR code affixed to it. Once you scan the code, you will find the entire journey of the fruit from farm to home. You can get to know where your fruit was grown, who was the farmer, and how your fruit reached you. We believe in being 100% transparent with our consumers.
