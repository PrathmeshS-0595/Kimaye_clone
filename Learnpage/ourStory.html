                      <p>Kimaye began as a collaborative effort by a husband-wife duo who left their cushy careers to start INI Farms. The result? Kimaye became India's first brand to retail fresh fruits in the USA. While one looks after the operations, the other manages sales and marketing. Meet the founders of Kimaye: Purnima and Pankaj Khandelwal.</p>

                <div>
                   <p>An IIT/IIM/McKinsey Alumnus, Pankaj decided to pursue horticulture. He found this to be an ideal combination of art and science with an ability to make a real difference in the life of farmers. Purnima, an economics graduate and MBA comes from a business family. An entrepreneur at core, Purnima found her passion in building an Indian-origin Global Fruit Brand.</p>

                <div>
                   <p>Way back in 2009, both of them realized that the horticulture sector was highly fragmented and unorganised. The duo was firm about having an integrated value-chain approach with focus on quality over quantity. They chose the 'one fruit at a time' approach over a whole fruit basket and began supplying pomegranates to domestic and international markets. Today, INI has become one of the largest exporter of pomegranates, bananas, and coconuts.</p>

                   <p>Pankaj and Purnima sowed the seeds of quality and efficiency and reaped the fruits in the form of a loyal farmer and customer base. One thing has stayed consistent through the years — their promise of providing safe fruits.</p>
